# TST NSLS-II Device Restructuring Summary

## Overview

The TST NSLS-II BITS device structure has been significantly simplified and consolidated to follow best practices and eliminate duplication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed `device_creators.py`
- Eliminated the intermediate device creator functions
- Moved device class definitions directly into individual device modules

### 2. Created Individual Device Modules
Each device type now has its own dedicated module with a single device class:

- **`tst_motor.py`**: Contains `TSTMotor` class
  - Enhanced Motor class with TST-specific configuration
  - Automatic mock mode detection

- **`tst_detector.py`**: Contains `TSTDetector` class
  - Enhanced VimbaDetector with TST path provider
  - NSLS-II compliant data organization

- **`tst_panda.py`**: Contains `TSTPanda` class
  - Enhanced HDFPanda with TST path provider
  - Integrated trigger coordination

- **`tst_flyer.py`**: Consolidated all flyer functionality
  - Basic `TSTFlyer` class
  - Advanced classes: `TSTTriggerLogic`, `TSTMantaFlyer`, `TSTPandAFlyer`
  - Coordination: `TSTFlyerCoordinator`, `TimingValidator`
  - Factory functions: `create_tst_flyers()`, `create_advanced_flyer_coordinator()`

### 3. Removed Redundant Files
Deleted the following files that were superseded by the new structure:
- `detectors.py`
- `motors.py`
- `panda.py`
- `flyers.py`
- `advanced_flyers.py`

### 4. Configuration Centralization
- All device PV prefixes are now in `configs/devices.yml`
- Removed device configuration from `iconfig.yml`
- MOCK mode configuration added to top of `startup.py`

### 5. Updated Device Configuration

**Before (devices.yml):**
```yaml
tst_instrument.utils.device_creators.create_tst_motor:
- name: rot_motor
  prefix: "XF:31ID1-OP:1{CMT:1-Ax:Rot}Mtr"
```

**After (devices.yml):**
```yaml
tst_instrument.devices.tst_motor.TSTMotor:
- name: rot_motor
  prefix: "XF:31ID1-OP:1{CMT:1-Ax:Rot}Mtr"
  labels: ["motors", "rotation", "baseline"]
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Structure**: Each device type has one file with one class
2. **Direct Instantiation**: Devices are instantiated directly by BITS framework
3. **No Intermediate Functions**: Removed unnecessary abstraction layer
4. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Less code duplication and clearer dependencies

## Testing

Created `scripts/test.py` that demonstrates:
- Importing TST startup
- Listing all devices via oregistry
- Listing available plans
- Running mock plans

To run the test:
```bash
python scripts/test.py
```

## Migration Notes

For any code that was using the old imports:
```python
# Old way
from tst_instrument.devices import create_tst_motors

# New way
from tst_instrument.devices import TSTMotor
# Device instantiation is handled by BITS framework via devices.yml
```

The devices are still accessible via oregistry as before:
```python
from apsbits.core.instrument_init import oregistry
motor = oregistry.find(name="rot_motor")
```
